I chose to start with heuristics to get an idea of the holistic experience. Diagramming the high level flow helped identify potential roadblocks and abandonment locations. I then worked with the UX Research team on contextual inquiries and collected behavioral data from our analytics to verify my conclusions. Our results confirmed that we needed to focus on removing barriers and reducing the effort involved in placing an order.</p></div><aside><video src="assets/video/diagram.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/diagram.png" srcset="assets/img/diagram-2x.png 2x"></video></aside><section><div><h2>Cart<span>Balancing customer needs & stakeholder objectives</span></h2><p>Stakeholders were unhappy with the way the cart page was performing. They saw the cart as a final upsell opportunity, wanting it to increase the average order totals while also performing its primary task of initiating checkout. Customers, on the other hand, use the cart as a multi-purpose storage solution (save for later, favorites, comparisons, purchasing, etc.) irrespective of their intention to buy. This misalignment caused a hit in metric performance.</p><p>The challenge was finding a solution where business and customer goals could coexist. After a few wireframes, I realized that adjustments to the layout and visual hierarchy were doing nothing to balance the cart’s purposes. The real problem was that the page itself was leading customers in opposite directions: progress to checkout or continue shopping. The only way to reconcile these cross-purposes was to make the cart a part of the shopping experience.</p><p>Replacing the dedicated page with a perpetual cart promotes continuous shopping, which increased order totals, and allows customers to initiate checkout as soon as they’re ready to make their purchase. This accomplishes both of the stakeholders’ goals, while also providing a better experience for the customer.</p></div><figure><video src="assets/video/cart-full.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/perp-cart.png" srcset="assets/img/perp-cart-2x.png 2x"></video><figcaption>Wireframe of the perpetual cart.</figcaption></figure></section><aside><video src="assets/video/login.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/login.png" srcset="assets/img/login-2x.png 2x"></video></aside><section><figure><video src="assets/video/order-sync.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/order-sync.png" srcset="assets/img/order-sync-2x.png 2x"></video><figcaption>Diagram of order sync logic</figcaption></figure><div><h2>Login<span>Removing the barrier</span></h2><p>Requiring an account to place an order was preventing customers from completing their purchase, regardless of whether they were new or returning. New customers don’t have any reason to trust us yet, so they’re hesitant to store their personal information. Returning customers often forget their password, or that they even have an account at all, setting them on a frustrating loop that frequently ends in password resetting or purchase abandonment.</p><p>Guest checkout seemed like an obvious solution; a simple button taking customers straight to checkout without any account verification. This concept made me want to challenge the ’returning customer or guest’ paradigm altogether. Placing an order should be as effortless as possible, and the experience should be the same regardless of whether the customer is new or returning. A login page complicates the process. By removing it the shopping experience is kept seamless and opportunities for the customer to reconsider their order are reduced.</p><p>Removing the login requirement raised the question of how purchases were going to be added to a customer’s order history, but by relocating the email address input to the checkout page for receipt purposes it doubles as a way to sync the order to the account associated with it.</p></div></section><aside><video src="assets/video/no-login.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/no-login.png" srcset="assets/img/no-login-2x.png 2x"></video></aside><section><div><h2>Checkout<span>Streamlining the process</span></h2><p>The checkout page was cluttered with form elements and policies, which added to the visual weight and caused the form to look longer and more complex than it actually was.</p><p>We removed the policies and other non-form elements in a series of A/B tests. The results confirmed that the perceived length and complexity of the page had a negative effect on conversion.</p><p>Once I knew the design could be focused on the form, I started simplifying it to reduce interactions and errors. Addresses, which make up most of the required fields, were consolidated to a single input by utilizing an address lookup API. Credit Card entry was reduced from four fields to one by having the card number input serve as a mask for the expiration date. Ultimately, the form was reduced from 18 required input fields down to 6, and optional fields were placed behind interaction elements in order to maintain the form’s ease of use and streamlined appearance.</p></div><figure><video src="assets/video/checkout-full.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/new-checkout.png" srcset="assets/img/new-checkout-2x.png 2x"></video><figcaption class="caption">Wireframe of checkout page iterations</figcaption></figure></section><aside><video src="assets/video/checkout.m4v"><img alt="" src="assets/img/final-flow.png" srcset="assets/img/final-flow-2x.png 2x"></video></aside><section><figure><video src="assets/video/mobile.m4v"></video><figcaption>iPhone app mock–up</figcaption></figure><div><h2>Conclusion<span>Frictionless checkout experience</span></h2><p>As a firm proponent of cross-platform consistency, I used this project as an opportunity to promote a responsive and uniform experience across all devices and platforms. Considerations for mobile users can be seen in details like the larger fields and buttons to accommodate touch input, text size optimized for small screens, and input fields that keep typing and keyboard switching to a minimum.</p><p>With an updated cart, no login requirement, and a smoother checkout process making a purchase would be easier and more intuitive, providing a more pleasing experience for the customer and increasing revenue for the company.</p></div></section><aside class="last"><video controls src="assets/video/demo-alt.m4v"></video></aside></article></main><script>window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
