I chose to start with heuristics to get an idea of the holistic experience and identify potential roadblocks and abandonment locations.</p><figure class="heuristics"><img src="img/co-heuristics.png" srcset="img/co-heuristics@2x.png 2x"></figure><h2>Putting Focus on the Form</h2><p>Through a series of A/B tests, we started decluttering the interface by removing non–form elements to keep customers focused on the form. The goal of these tests was to verify whether the perceived length and visual weight of the page had a negative effect on conversion.</p><figure><video autoplay controls loop src="vid/abtest3.m4v"></video></figure><p>The next step was to improve the checkout form and reduce errors.</p><h2>Shipping Form</h2><p>Addresses—which make up most of the required fields—were consolidated to a single input by utilizing an address lookup API.</p><figure style="max-width:512px"><video autoplay controls loop src="vid/shipping.m4v"></video></figure><h2>Payment Form</h2><p>Credit Card entry was reduced from four fields to one by having the card number input serve as a mask for the expiration date. This also eliminated dropdown UI which required several interaction steps on mobile.</p><figure style="max-width:512px"><video autoplay controls loop src="vid/payment.m4v"></video></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, the form was reduced from 18 required input fields down to 6. Optional fields were placed behind interaction elements in order to maintain the form’s ease of use and streamlined appearance.</p><figure><video autoplay controls loop src="vid/checkout.m4v" class="shadow"></video></figure></main><nav role="navigation"><a href="xoxo.html"><dl class="project"><dt class="project--name">Product Exchange</dt><dd class="project--company">Zappos Mobile</dd><dd class="project--role">UX & Interface Design</dd></dl></a><a href="pdp.html"><dl class="project"><dt class="project--name">Product Details View</dt><dd class="project--company">Zappos Mobile</dd><dd class="project--role">UX & Interface Design</dd></dl></a></nav></body></html>
