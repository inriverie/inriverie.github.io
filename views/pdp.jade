    p.lead The Zappos iPad app was launched when much of the mobile landscape was still being discovered. As a result, the product detail view was built around basic functionality rather than the unique challenges that new platforms present. My goal was to address these challenges while keeping the product page’s performance intact.

        h2 Ergonomics
        p First I had users interact with a background image so I could measure reach and observe their comfort levels, particularly for two–handed use.

        )

      div.text-block
        h2 Concepts & Wireframes
        p Next I took an inventory of elements, grouping them based on whether they were a part of the purchase flow or the information seeking flow. Knowing that the layout needed to accommodate thumb input, my concepts focused on keeping interactions at the screen edge.

        p The vertical space offered in portrait orientation, along with it being the preferred orientation for reading, lent itself well to the information seeking customer without reducing the image size or impeding the “add to cart” flow.

          srcset='img/pdp-final-portrait@2x.png 2x'
        )
      div.text-block
        p Based on media viewing preferences I decided to make the landscape orientation focus on the imagery while keeping the purchase flow intact. Product information is exposed with a vertical swipe.
