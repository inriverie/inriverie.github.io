    p.lead As Lead UX Designer for the Zappos Checkout team, I initiated an effort to improve the checkout experience and increase conversion, retention, and new customer acquisition.

        p First I needed to understand where and why customers were abandoning their purchases. I chose to start with heuristics to get an idea of the holistic experience and identify potential roadblocks and abandonment locations.

        h2 Putting Focus on the Form
        p We performed a series of A/B tests on the checkout form by removing non-form elements, and determined that the perceived length and visual weight of the page had a negative effect on conversion.

        h2 Simplifying the Form
        p Building on the results of the AB tests I set out to improve the checkout form and reduce errors. I consolidated the address—which makes up most of the required fields—into a single input by utilizing an address lookup API and reduced the credit card entry from four fields to one by having the card number input serve as a mask for the expiration date.

        h2 Conclusion
        p Ultimately, the form was reduced from 18 required input fields to 6. Optional fields were placed behind interaction elements in order to maintain the form’s streamlined appearance and ease of use.
