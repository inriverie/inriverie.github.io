    p.lead Exchange requests accounted for a significant portion of the call center’s inbound calls. I was tasked with designing the exchange process on the iPhone app in an effort to empower customers, allowing the customer service team to be available for high priority issues.

        h2 Simplifying the Returns Flow
        p The app already allowed customers to process their own returns. I wanted to have returns and exchanges in the same flow—both for interaction familiarity and to reduce the number of steps for customers with an exchange and a return in the same order.

        p I removed the need to trigger the return process as I felt it was an unnecessary step. I also discovered that UPS Flex labels are accepted at USPS locations—eliminating the need to choose a carrier.

        h2 Exchanges
        p Exchanges only require two additional steps in the return flow: selecting a new size and/or color, and a legal agreement due to exchange orders being shipped prior to receiving the return.
