Any header elements may include links, as depicted in the example.</p><p>The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using an <code>h2</code> unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing <code>h2</code> element.</p><h3>Third-Level Header <a href='#'>Linked</a></h3><p>The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p><h4>Fourth-Level Header <a href='#'>Linked</a></h4><p>The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p><h5>Fifth-Level Header <a href='#'>Linked</a></h5><p>The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p><h6>Sixth-Level Header <a href='#'>Linked</a></h6><p>The header above is an <code>h6</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p></section><section id="grouping"><h2>Grouping Content</h2><section><h3>Ordered list</h3><p>The <code>ol</code> element denotes an ordered list, and various numbering schemes are available through the CSS (including 1,2,3… a,b,c… i,ii,iii… and so on). Each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items within the list (as you may have guessed, <code>li</code> stands for list item).</p><div class="example"><ol><li>This is an ordered list.<li>This is the second item, which contains a sub list<ol><li>This is the sub list, which is also ordered.</li><li>It has two items.</li></ol></li></li><li>This is the final item on this list.</li></ol></div></section><section><h3>Unordered list</h3><p>The <code>ul</code> element denotes an unordered list (ie. a list of loose items that don’t require numbering, or a bulleted list). Again, each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items. Here is an example list showing the constituent parts of the British Isles:</p><div class="example"><ul><li>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:<ul><li>England</li><li>Scotland</li><li>Wales</li><li>Northern Ireland</li></ul></li><li>Republic of Ireland</li><li>Isle of Man</li><li>Channel Islands:<ul><li>Bailiwick of Guernsey</li><li>Bailiwick of Jersey</li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Sometimes we may want each list item to contain block elements, typically a paragraph or two.</p><div class="example"><ul><li><p>The British Isles is an archipelago consisting of the two large islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and many smaller surrounding islands.</p></li><li><p>Great Britain is the largest island of the archipelago. Ireland is the second largest island of the archipelago and lies directly to the west of Great Britain.</p></li><li><p>The full list of islands in the British Isles includes over 1,000 islands, of which 51 have an area larger than 20 km<sup>2</sup>.</p></li></ul></div></section><section><h3>Definition list</h3><p>The <code>dl</code> element is for another type of list called a definition list. Instead of list items, the content of a <code>dl</code> consists of <code>dt</code> (Definition Term) and <code>dd</code> (Definition description) pairs. Though it may be called a “definition list”, <code>dl</code> can apply to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable. For example, it may be used for marking up dialogues, with each <code>dt</code> naming a speaker, and each <code>dd</code> containing his or her words.</p><div class="example"><dl><dt>This is a term.</dt><dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd><dt>Here is another term.</dt><dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd><dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt><dt>Here is a defined term.</dt><dd><code>dt</code> terms may stand on their own without an accompanying <code>dd</code>, but in that case they <em>share</em> descriptions with the next available <code>dt</code>. You may not have a <code>dd</code> without a parent <code>dt</code>.</dd></dl></div></section></section><section id="text"><h2>Text-level Semantics</h2><p>There are a number of inline <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements you may use anywhere within other elements.</p><section><h3>Links and anchors</h3><p>The <code>a</code> element is used to hyperlink text, be that to another page, a named fragment on the current page or any other location on the web. Example:</p><div class="example"><p><a href="/">Go to the home page </a>or <a href="#banner">return to the top of this page</a>.</p></div></section><section><h3>Stressed emphasis</h3><p>The <code>em</code> element is used to denote text with stressed emphasis, i.e., something you’d pronounce differently. Where italicizing is required for stylistic differentiation, the <code>i</code> element may be preferable. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>You simply <em>must</em> try the negitoro maki!</p></div></section><section><h3>Strong importance</h3><p>The <code>strong</code> element is used to denote text with strong importance. Where bolding is used for stylistic differentiation, the <code>b</code> element may be preferable. Example: </p><div class="example"><p> <strong>Don’t </strong>stick nails in the electrical outlet.</p></div></section><section><h3>Small print</h3><p>The <code>small</code> element is used to represent disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights (commonly referred to as ‘small print’). It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements. Example:</p><div class="example"><p><small>Copyright © 1922-2011 Acme Corporation. All Rights Reserved.</small></p></div></section><section><h3>Citations</h3><p>The <code>cite</code> element is used to represent the title of a work (e.g. a book, essay, poem, song, film, TV show, sculpture, painting, musical, exhibition, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. Example:</p><div class="example"><p><cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</cite>United Nations, December 1948. Adopted by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III).</p></div></section><section><h3>Inline quotes</h3><p>The <code>q</code> element is used for quoting text inline. Example showing nested quotations:</p><div class="example"><p>John said, <q>I saw Lucy at lunch, she told me <q>Mary wants you to get some ice cream on your way home</q>. I think I will get some at Ben and Jerry’s, on Gloucester Road.</q></p></div></section><section><h3>Definition</h3><p>The <code>dfn</code> element is used to highlight the first use of a term. The <code>title</code> attribute can be used to describe the term. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>Bob’s <dfn title="Dog">canine</dfn> mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father sat him down and carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines two or more sets of chromosomes from different species">allopolyploid</dfn> organism.</p></div></section><section><h3>Abbreviation</h3><p>The <code>abbr</code> element is used for any abbreviated text, whether it be acronym, initialism, or otherwise. Generally, it’s less work and useful (enough) to mark up only the first occurrence of any particular abbreviation on a page, and ignore the rest. Any text in the <code>title</code> attribute will appear when the user’s mouse hovers the abbreviation (although notably, this does not work in Internet Explorer for Windows). Example abbreviations:</p><div class="example"><p><abbr title="British Broadcasting Corportation">BBC, </abbr><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML, </abbr>and <abbr title="Staffordshire">Staffs</abbr></p></div></section><section><h3>Time</h3><p>The <code>time</code> element is used to represent either a time on a 24 hour clock, or a precise date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>Queen Elizabeth II was proclaimed sovereign of each of the Commonwealth realms on <time datetime="1952-02-6">6</time> and <time datetime="1952-02-7">7 February 1952</time>, after the death of her father, King George VI.</p></div></section><section><h3>Superscript and subscript text</h3><p>The <code>sup</code> element represents a superscript and the sub element represents a <code>sub</code>. These elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation. As a guide, only use these elements if their absence would change the meaning of the content. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>The coordinate of the <var>i</var>th point is (<var>x<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>, <var>y<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>). For example, the 10th point has coordinate (<var>x<sub>10</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>10</sub></var>).</p><p>f(<var>x</var>, <var>n</var>) = log<sub>4</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>n</var></sup></p></div></section><section><h3>Italicised</h3><p>The <code>i</code> element is used for text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose. Examples include taxonomic designations, technical terms, idiomatic phrases from another language, the name of a ship or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically italicised. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p></div></section><section><h3>Emboldened</h3><p>The <code>b</code> element is used for text stylistically offset from normal prose without conveying extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typographic presentation is typically emboldened. Example:</p><div class="example"><p>You enter a small room. Your <b>sword</b> glows brighter. A <b>rat</b> scurries past the corner wall.</p></div></section></section></article></main><nav role="navigation"><ul><li><a href="styleguide.html">Styleguide directory</a></li><li>Basic styles</li><li><a href="ui-styles.html"><abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> pattern library</a></li><li><a href="form-styles.html">Form elements</a></li></ul></nav></body></html>
